# Inventory-Management-app
Final capstone project for perscholas 
This a full-stack clothing store management tool web app, to keep track of inventory for any type of e-commerce business. Spring boot serves as the backend and React to display the front end. Packages used to develop this app are Bootstrap for container and column styling and Axios to make API calls to the backend.

To start this program, clone this repository to a local directory on your computer. Before anything, make sure to enter your MySQL credentials and database location in the application.properties file in your spring boot Java folder. Then, deploy the web app backend in spring boot; after the back end is up and running cd into the directory where the React front-end is located. Next, run npm install in your terminal to install all needed dependencies needed for node js. Next, start the react project with npm start.

The major use for this web app is to add have the ability to add, edit and delete your inventory; store it on a MySQL server. My future plans to improve this project are to make a user section that can keep track of customer transactions; as well as implementing charts that keep track of your data and have the ability to run query searches to relate customer information and product sales.
